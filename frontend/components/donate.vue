            <li>Donate to the Tor Project: Your contribution directly benefits the people working for the Tor project and
                funds development and outreach.</li>
            <li>Donate to Torservers.net: They maintain many high-speed Tor nodes, and your money will be used to increase
                Tor capacity.</li>
            <li>Share this page with your friends: Maybe one of them wants to run their own server.</li>
            <li>Help keep this site running: Donate to me directly or try the Brave Browser with built-in Adblocker and Tor
